## CNN-based Hand Sign Recognition and LSTM-based Time-Series Analysis

This repository contains two key components:
1. CNN-based Hand Sign Recognition - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing hand signs from images, typically used for gesture-based interaction systems.
2. LSTM-based Time-Series Analysis - A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for time-series analysis, focusing on tasks such as classifying and predicting sequential data.
