### Observations ###

1. Overfitting Issues:
Analyzing the training and validation curves, it can be observed whether there is a gap between training and validation loss/accuracy, indicating overfitting.
Adding a Dropout layer with rate 0.4 can further reduce overfitting by increasing regularization.

2. Share Structure Property:
The CNN architecture uses shared convolutional kernels that extract features irrespective of the position of the feature in the image.

3. Invariance Property:
The pooling layers ensure translational invariance by reducing the sensitivity of the network to small spatial shifts in the input images.

4. Recommendations:
- Consider adding another Dropout layer (rate 0.4) after the convolutional layers to address overfitting.
- Use techniques like data augmentation (rotation, flipping, scaling) to improve the model's generalization.
- Experiment with different optimizer hyperparameters for further improvement.
